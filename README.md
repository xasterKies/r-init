# R-init

> A CLI that helps you initialize your github reposiotries from your terminal.

![Alt text](./r-init.png "R-init CLI")

I started this project because i always had to move out from my workspace when I wanted to create or initialize new repositories to work on and that always made me loose some focus along the way. In an attempt of being productive i started coding this simple tool.
